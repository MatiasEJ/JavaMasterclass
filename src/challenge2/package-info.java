//POLYMORPHISM
/**
 * We are going to go back to the car analogy, create a base class caller challenge2.Car.
 * It should have a few fields that would be appriopiate for a generic car class: engine, cylinders, wheels
 * Constructor should initalizae cylinders (number of) and name, and set the wheels to  and engine to true.
 * Cylinders and names would be passed parameters.
 * 
 * Create appriopiate getters
 * 
 * Create some methods like StartEngine, accelerate and brake
 * 
 * show a message for each in the base class
 * now create 3 sub classes for your favorite vehicles 
 * Override the appropiate methods to demostrate polymorphism in use
 * put all classe in one java file**/
